Spice up that contribution history with this little script!

## Task List

Preferably python script that accepts a directory for input (full path name)
and executes the script on that path. Path must be remotely git initialized!

Still deciding between python and shell script - in development currently.

## Conributors

Simon Zhou and Anshul Aggarwal
